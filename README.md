# Programming Logic

This repository contains Python programming logic exercises. They are designed to help develop essential skills for solving computational problems. The challenges include list manipulation, conditional structures, loops, and creating efficient algorithms, making them ideal for beginners and enthusiasts who want to improve their knowledge.

## ðŸš€ How to use the scripts

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your local machine. We recommend version 3.6 or higher.
2. The scripts can be executed directly in the terminal or using IDEs like **PyCharm**, **VS Code**, or **Jupyter Notebook**.

## ðŸ§ª Testing the exercises

### Important Notice
Some exercises, including the program that calculates a student's grade based on their responses, require terminal interaction. Therefore, **we recommend testing them on Google Colab or another interactive environment** for the best testing experience.

### Testing on Google Colab
1. Access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Upload the Python file (.py) or copy the code directly into a cell on Colab.
3. Run the code and follow the instructions displayed on the screen.
